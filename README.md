Hate speech detection is a critical area of research in natural language processing,
addressing the growing need to identify and mitigate harmful online content. In this study,
i developed a Python-based system that classifies textual input as either hate speech or nonhate speech. The system leverages a machine learning model trained on a labeled dataset of
social media posts and other online communications.To achieve this, i employed a pipeline
that includes text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. Text preprocessing
steps involved tokenization, removal of stop words, and stemming to normalize the input
data. Feature extraction was performed using techniques such as TF-IDF (Term FrequencyInverse Document Frequency) to convert textual data into numerical vectors suitable for
machine learning algorithms. For the classification task, i experimented with various
algorithms, including logistic regression, support vector machines, and neural networks,
selecting the best performing model based on accuracy and other relevant metrics. My
system accepts input directly from the console, allowing users to type in statements that are
then analyzed in real time. The final model demonstrates high accuracy in detecting hate
speech, offering a robust tool for moderating content in online platforms. This approach
highlights the potential of machine learning techniques in automating the identification of
harmful language, contributing to safer and more inclusive digital environments. Further
enhancements and testing on diverse datasets are recommended to improve the system's
generalizability and effectiveness across different contexts and languages.
